# Ug-project--Tuberculosis-classification-using-CXR
The rationale of this project is to aid the diagnosis of Tuberculosis at full tilt by reducing the
patientâ€™s period of waiting thereby cutting down unnecessary complications and accelerating the
treatments for those who need it. Also, due to its easy accessibility and inexpensive nature, it can be
used as a tool for mass screenings in the goal of eradication of TB along with other important
screening tests.Due to significant differences between the X-ray images of infected & non infected
patients,we can identify the presence and severity of the infection.Here we propose a classifier
model which is the TB Classifier which analyzes the chest X-rays and aid in the diagnosis along
with other standard test results such as Mantoux test and Sputum Smear Grading.The TB Classifier
is a CNN model tailored to classify the X-ray images as Tuberculosis Positive or Negative. This
CNN model is trained using publicly available dataset and obtained an accuracy of 97.62% on
training the test set. The data used to train the model was obtained from the Kaggle dataset.
Additionally, Spirometry Interpreter is developed to identify the obstructive/restrictive pattern of
respiratory diseases using FEV1/FVC values and COPD Exacerbation detector to predict the
forthcoming exacerbations if present using a by prompting the patients to enter the severity of the
listed symptoms represented in a form of Likert scale. The main webpage is structured in a way to
address the emerging trends in pulmonary diseases, the ramifications due to climate change and the
epidemiological trends of these CRDs.
